44,"CLARIN Depositing Services","CLARIN centres offer a depositing service. They are willing to store the resources in their repository and assist with the technical and organisational details. This has a wide range of advantages:

Long-term archiving: a storage guarantee can be given for a long period (up to 50 years in some cases)
Resources can be cited easily with a persistent identifier.
The resources and their metadata will be integrated into the infrastructure, making it possibe to search them efficiently.
Password-protected resources can be made available via an institutional login.
Once resources are integrated in the CLARIN infrastructure, they can be analyzed and enriched more easily with various linguistic tools (e.g. automated part-of-speech tagging, phonetic alignment or audio/video analysis).
