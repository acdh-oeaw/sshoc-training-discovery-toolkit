SSK_sc_1559121592381,"Archiving Reflectance Transformation Imaging Datasets","Reflectance Transformation Imaging, a computational photography method based on the principle of raking light, has been extensively used in fields such as archaeology, museum studies, and art history to capture and enhance subtle surface details. Low-angled and multidirectional light creates texture details and enhances planar irregularities. There are two methods to capture RTI images: the Dome Method and the Highlight RTI Method. In both methods, objects are photographed with a single camera in a fixed position. The only element that changes in the process is the position of light. In the Dome method the light position is known since lights are fixed. In the highlight method the position of the light is captured by using reflective spheres that are then used by a specialised software to create the RTI image. The images stack is then computed into a polynomial texture map. In a dedicated viewer, the resulting file can be viewed under individual light positions and different rendering algorithms. This scenario focuses on the preparation of captured RTI data for archiving. The main component of an RTI dataset is photographies. Additionally some software-dependent formats will have to be considered for archiving.",http://ssk.huma-num.fr/#/scenarios/SSK_sc_1559121592381,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,1|2|3|4,English,6,steps,"Archaeology and Prehistory|Art and art history","Photography|Images|Images (3D)",2019-05-29T12:22:14Z,2019-05-29T13:09:40Z,40

Hence, scholars who want to base their research on digitized texts, especially if working with popular works, may find a considerable amount of resources already digitized and ready to use. However, with these resources originating from various data providers (individual scholars, singular research projects, large infrastructures, ...) scholars usually face a great variety of digitization guidelines and formats. Gathering resources from different sources will hence almost always require their harmonization on different levels of processing.

There are various tools and frameworks to perform the steps in this scenario that can be used depending on the language/s you are working with or your programming environment. A number of tool-boxes for Natural language processing (NLP) exist, which are able to perform several of the annotation steps in an integrated way. These resources are listed below under ""Using an existing NLP pipeline"". The next step after performing the procedures described in this scenario usually is to put the annotated corpus into a corpus query engine to query and analyze it based on its annotations.

SSK_sc_Preservation3DObjects,"Preserving 3D digital objects","The long-term preservation of 3D digital objects raises some critical issues. Indeed, firstly, different kind of data can be archived: the original files depending on the method used to digitize; the final version, depending on the goal (simple acquisition or modelisation) and any relevant information (text, images, pdf , scenarios ...) added for a better comprehension of the 3D object. Secondly it is important that metadata accompany the archive to ensure that the 3D object will be human-readable in the long-term. These metadata have to be completed in distinct files. The 3D consortium of Huma-Num developed a tool, aLTAG3D to easily produce metadata file for the full 3D archive. Lastly, a place to preserve 3D data in the long term has to be found. Many solutions exist, depending on the countries. In France, there are solutions such as the 3D conservatory for 3D data research for mid-term preservation, and the CINES in the continuity for long-term preservation.",http://ssk.huma-num.fr/#/scenarios/SSK_sc_Preservation3DObjects,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,40|41|42|43|44|45|46,English,5,steps,"Archaeology and Prehistory|Cultural heritage and museology","Georeferencing|Photography|Preservation Metadata|Scanning|Technology Preservation|Images (3D)",2018-06-20T09:39:21Z,2019-04-06T13:20:08Z,40
